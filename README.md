# BeatQueue

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

BeatQueue is a web app designed to solve one of the biggest headaches for performing DJs: managing song requests. It replaces the chaos of people shouting requests or showing you their phones with a simple, live queue. As the DJ, you create a room, share a link, and the crowd can add and upvote songs from Apple Music and SoundCloud. This way, I can keep the flow of the set while also getting real-time feedback on what the crowd wants to hear.

### Design

**1. Login Screen**

A minimal login/registration page. Just the app name, inputs for email/password, and a login button.

**2. Main Event Screen (DJ View)**

This is the main interface. It'll show the event name, a list of requested songs with their upvote counts, and controls for the DJ to manage the queue. The search bar will have a clear toggle to switch between searching Apple Music and SoundCloud.

### Key Features

- Standard, secure login and registration for DJs
- DJs can spin up a new event room with a unique, shareable URL
- The playlist is collaborative and updates for everyone instantly. No page refreshes needed
- Guests can pull tracks from Apple Music for official releases and SoundCloud for all the essential remixes and bootlegs
- A simple upvote feature lets the crowd push the most popular requests to the top
- The DJ has final say and can manage the queue by removing tracks or marking them as played

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML:** The structure will be built with semantic HTML5â€”one page for login and another for the main app interface.
- **CSS:** The styling will be a clean, responsive dark-mode UI built with standard CSS. It needs to look good on a laptop in a dark room and on a guest's phone. I'll add some simple transitions for a smoother feel.
- **React:** - Provides login, event dashboard, song queue, song, music search, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - register
    - login
    - events
    - eventId
    - search
- **DB/Login** - Stores user data, events (each room's data and song queue). Credentials securely stored in database. Can't access unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket:** - When a user add or upvotes a song, it's broadcast to all other users.
