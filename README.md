# BeatQueue

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

BeatQueue is a web app designed to solve one of the biggest headaches for performing DJs: managing song requests. It replaces the chaos of people shouting requests or showing you their phones with a simple, live queue. As the DJ, you create a room, share a link, and the crowd can add and upvote songs from Apple Music and SoundCloud. This way, I can keep the flow of the set while also getting real-time feedback on what the crowd wants to hear.

### Design

**1. Login Screen**

A minimal login/registration page. Just the app name, inputs for email/password, and a login button.

**2. Main Event Screen (DJ View)**

This is the main interface. It'll show the event name, a list of requested songs with their upvote counts, and controls for the DJ to manage the queue. The search bar will have a clear toggle to switch between searching Apple Music and SoundCloud.

### Key Features

- Standard, secure login and registration for DJs
- DJs can spin up a new event room with a unique, shareable URL
- The playlist is collaborative and updates for everyone instantly. No page refreshes needed
- Guests can pull tracks from Apple Music for official releases and SoundCloud for all the essential remixes and bootlegs
- A simple upvote feature lets the crowd push the most popular requests to the top
- The DJ has final say and can manage the queue by removing tracks or marking them as played

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML:** The structure will be built with semantic HTML5â€”one page for login and another for the main app interface.
- **CSS:** The styling will be a clean, responsive dark-mode UI built with standard CSS. It needs to look good on a laptop in a dark room and on a guest's phone. I'll add some simple transitions for a smoother feel.
- **React:** - Provides login, event dashboard, song queue, song, music search, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - register
    - login
    - events
    - eventId
    - search
- **DB/Login** - Stores user data, events (each room's data and song queue). Credentials securely stored in database. Can't access unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket:** - When a user add or upvotes a song, it's broadcast to all other users.

## Deployment instructions

1. Clone this repository to your development environment.
1. Create a `dbConfig.json` file that contains the credentials to access your Mongo Database. This must be placed in the root of the project.

   ```json
   {
     "hostname": "YourMongoDbAccount.xiu1cqz.mongodb.net",
     "userName": "YourMongoDbUsername",
     "password": "YourMongoDbPassword"
   }
   ```

1. NPM install both the frontend and backend dependencies.

   ```sh
   npm install
   cd ui
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

1. Use the `deploy.sh` shell script to deploy Voter to an EC2 instance. You will need the PEM key in order to run the script.

   ```sh
   ./deploy.sh -k ~/keys/yourkeyhere.pem -h yourdomainnamehere.click
   ```

1. Verify that the application is running on the domain.

   ```sh
   curl startup.cs260.click
   ```

1. **Optional**: If you want to modify the candidates that are currently voted on then alter `finalists.json`. The format of the file is as follows:

   ```json
   {
     "candidate": [{ "name": "Meg", "url": "https://game.com", "votes": 0, "id": "game" }]
   }
   ```

   You can update the candidates with the following endpoint call:

   ```sh
   curl -X PUT localhost:4000/api/candidate -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '@finalists.json'
   ```

## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- [x] **HTML pages** - Two HTML page that represent the ability to login and vote.
- [x] **Links** - The login page automatically links to the voter page. The voter page contains links for every voting choice.
- [x] **Text** - Each of the voting choices is represented by a textual description.
- [ ] **Images** - I couldn't figure out how to include an image and so I didn't do this. ðŸ˜”
- [x] **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The voting choices represent data pulled from the database.
- [x] **WebSocket** - The count of voting results represent the tally of realtime votes.

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body**
- [x] **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- [x] **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace
- [x] **Application text content** - Consistent fonts
- [ ] **Application images** - Still don't have images and so no styling here. ðŸ˜”

## React Phase 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React so that the application completely works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - So amazing what Vite does. Bundling, transpiling, minifying, and HMR.
- [x] **Components** - I have three components: The app, the ballot items, and a bouncy ball.
- [x] **Router** - Routing between login and voting components.

- [x] **Bundled and transpiled** - done!
- [x] **Components** - Login, voting list, vote are all components with mocks for login, WebSocket.
  - [x] **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the voting page.
  - [x] **database** - Displayed the voting counts. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
  - [x] **WebSocket** - I used the setInterval function to periodically increase a random vote count. This will be replaced with WebSocket messages later.
  - [x] **application logic** - The highlight and ranking number change based up the user's selections.
- [x] **Router** - Routing between login and voting components.
- [x] **Hooks** - Vue uses class properties instead of `UseState` to track changes in vote state.

## React Phase 2: Reactivity deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React so that the application completely works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - Everything is working! Votes stored in local storage. `setInterval` used to simulate peer voting.
- [x] **Hooks** - Used `useState` and `useEffect` on the voter view.

## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives votes and returns the voting totals.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done!
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- [ ] **Calls to third party endpoints** - I didn't have time to implement this. ðŸ˜”
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server. Endpoints for voting.
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I did this using the fetch function.
- [ ] **Supports registration, login, logout, and restricted endpoint** - Login only exists on the frontend.

## DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I associate the votes with the logged in user. I stored the votes in the database.

- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!
- [x] **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores both user and their votes.

## WebSocket deliverable

For this deliverable I used webSocket to update the votes on the frontend in realtime.

- [x] **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - done!
- [x] **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - done!
- [x] **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - done!
- [x] **WebSocket data displayed** - All user votes display in realtime. I'm really proud that this is working. Way cool! ðŸŽ‰ I'm going to celebrate with my bestie over waffles!
