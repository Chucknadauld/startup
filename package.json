  "description": "BeatQueue is a web app designed to solve one of the biggest headaches for performing DJs: managing song requests. It replaces the chaos of people shouting requests or showing you their phones with a simple, live queue. As the DJ, you create a room, share a link, and the crowd can add and upvote songs from Apple Music and SoundCloud. This way, I can keep the flow of the set while also getting real-time feedback on what the crowd wants to hear.",
